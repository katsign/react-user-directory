## *Description*

This web app uses state management in React to allow a user to view, sort and filter through a list of users in a directory.

## *Installation*

### Local Clone

#### Navigate into the repository folder on your local machine and open the built-in terminal. You will need Node.js installed to run this application.

- On the command line, type `npm i` to pull the app's dependencies to your local.
- Type `npm start` to run the application locally.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the development server.

## *Usage*

- When the components mount to the DOM, a table of users from the [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) is displayed.
- Click `Sort A-Z` to sort the results by last name.
- Use the inline form to input a State and click `Filter` to view the results.
- These results can then be sorted by last name.
- Click `Clear Filter` to return a new set of users.
